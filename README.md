# Peertalk-Simple-Objective-C
An implementation/translation in Objective C of the PeerTalkManager Class found at https://github.com/kirankunigiri/peertalk-simple
The whole idea is based off that work. I just reimplemented it all in Objective-C.

Why?
* Because not everything is better in Swift
* Backwards compatibility
* Comfort zone
* Because I want to

What's it for?
* Simplifies Peertalk[https://github.com/rsms/peertalk] so that it's easier to use.
